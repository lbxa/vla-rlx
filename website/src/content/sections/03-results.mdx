We present comprehensive evaluation results across 12 manipulation tasks, including success rates, scaling analysis, failure taxonomy, and ablation studies focusing on VLA-specific design choices.

{/* TODO: Replace all placeholder data with your actual experimental results */}

### Closed-Loop Success Rates

We evaluate our method on 12 manipulation tasks with 30 independent trials per task (N=30, 360 total rollouts). All trials start from consistent initial states with randomized object positions (±3cm) and orientations (±30°).

*Table 6: Per-task success rates with 95% confidence intervals (Wilson score intervals). Success criteria are task-specific (see Experimental Setup section). Our method achieves 85.3% average success rate.*

| Task ID | Task Name | Success Rate | N | Task Definition |
|---------|-----------|--------------|---|-----------------|
| T1 | Pick and Place | 94.2% ± 4.8% | 30 | Cube in target zone (±2cm) |
| T2 | Stack Blocks | 78.5% ± 8.1% | 30 | Top block stable for 3s |
| T3 | Push to Goal | 91.7% ± 5.4% | 30 | Object in target (±3cm) |
| T4 | Open Drawer | 83.9% ± 7.2% | 30 | Drawer open &gt;8cm |
| T5 | Close Drawer | 88.2% ± 6.3% | 30 | Drawer closed (&lt;1cm) |
| T6 | Press Button | 96.8% ± 3.5% | 30 | Button pressed (visual detect) |
| T7 | Pick by Color | 85.7% ± 6.9% | 30 | Correct colored object grasped |
| T8 | Sort Objects | 72.3% ± 8.8% | 30 | All objects in correct bins |
| T9 | Reorient Object | 81.4% ± 7.6% | 30 | Object upright (±15°) |
| T10 | Slide Object | 89.6% ± 6.0% | 30 | Object moved &gt;10cm |
| T11 | Grasp from Clutter | 76.8% ± 8.3% | 30 | Target object extracted |
| T12 | Follow Trajectory | 84.5% ± 7.1% | 30 | End-effector within 2cm |
| **Average** | **All Tasks** | **85.3% ± 3.2%** | 360 | Weighted average |

**Key Observations:**
- Simple primitives (T1, T3, T6, T10) achieve &gt;90% success
- Multi-step tasks (T2, T8, T11) are more challenging (72-78%)
- Average success of 85.3% demonstrates robust performance
- Confidence intervals indicate stable, reproducible performance

### Scaling Curves

We analyze how performance scales with training data and fine-tuning steps.

#### Data Efficiency

*Table 7: Success rate vs. number of on-robot training episodes. Our approach reaches 85% success with just 50 episodes per task, demonstrating strong sample efficiency.*

{/* TODO: Fill in actual scaling data */}

| Episodes/Task | Avg Success Rate | Training Time | Total Episodes |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| 5 | 34.5% ± 9.2% | 0.25 hrs | 60 |
| 10 | 52.8% ± 8.1% | 0.5 hrs | 120 |
| 20 | 68.3% ± 6.5% | 1.0 hrs | 240 |
| 30 | 76.2% ± 5.3% | 1.5 hrs | 360 |
| 40 | 81.5% ± 4.2% | 2.0 hrs | 480 |
| **50** | **85.3% ± 3.2%** | **2.5 hrs** | **600** |
| 70 | 87.1% ± 3.8% | 3.5 hrs | 840 |
| 100 | 88.2% ± 3.5% | 5.0 hrs | 1200 |

**Insights:**
- Strong pre-training enables 52.8% success with only 10 episodes
- Diminishing returns after 50 episodes (marginal gain of 2.9pp from 50→100)
- Our selected budget of 50 episodes balances performance and efficiency

<Figure

{/* TODO: Replace with actual scaling curve */}

#### Fine-Tuning Steps

*Table 8: Success rate vs. PPO fine-tuning steps. Performance stabilizes after ~1000 steps per task.*

{/* TODO: Add actual fine-tuning curve data */}

| Fine-Tune Steps | Success Rate | Wall-Clock Time |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 0 (Zero-shot) | 34.2% ± 8.5% | 0 hrs |
| 250 | 58.7% ± 7.8% | 0.6 hrs |
| 500 | 72.4% ± 6.2% | 1.2 hrs |
| **1000** | **85.3% ± 3.2%** | **2.5 hrs** |
| 2000 | 86.1% ± 3.6% | 5.0 hrs |

**Observation:** 1000 steps provides optimal performance-time trade-off.

### Real-World Failure Analysis

We analyze 562 failure cases collected during evaluation and additional stress testing. Understanding failure modes is critical for improving robustness.

#### Failure Taxonomy

See detailed breakdown in the Limitations section. Key failure types:

1. **Perception Errors (28.3%):** Lighting changes, occlusion, misclassification
2. **Grasp Failures (24.5%):** Slippage, poor approach angles, drops
3. **Planning Errors (18.7%):** Collisions, inefficient paths, local minima
4. **Timeout (15.9%):** Slow execution, hesitation
5. **Instruction Errors (8.2%):** Wrong object, goal misinterpretation
6. **Hardware (4.4%):** Motor stalls, communication issues

<Figure

### VLA-Specific Ablations

We conduct ablation studies on design choices specific to vision-language-action models.

#### Ablation 1: Instruction Format

*Table 9: Impact of instruction formatting on success rate. Natural language outperforms template-based and code-like formats.*

{/* TODO: Add actual ablation results */}

| Instruction Format | Example | Success Rate | $\Delta$ |
|-------------------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Natural Language (Ours)** | "Pick up the red block" | **85.3%** | Baseline |
| Template-Based | "PICK(red, block)" | 76.8% | -8.5pp |
| Code-Like | `pick(color='red', obj='block')` | 71.2% | -14.1pp |
| Telegraphic | "red block pick" | 69.5% | -15.8pp |

**Insight:** Pre-trained VLAs benefit from natural, grammatical instructions that match pre-training data distribution.

#### Ablation 2: Visual Backbone

*Table 10: Comparison of different visual encoders. CLIP ViT-B/16 provides best balance of performance and efficiency.*

{/* TODO: Add actual ablation data */}

| Visual Backbone | Params | Inference (ms) | Success Rate | $\Delta$ |
|-----------------|--------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **CLIP ViT-B/16 (Ours)** | 86M | 48 | **85.3%** | Baseline |
| ResNet-50 | 25M | 22 | 78.2% | -7.1pp |
| ViT-L/14 | 307M | 156 | 86.1% | +0.8pp |
| DINOv2 ViT-B/14 | 86M | 52 | 83.7% | -1.6pp |
| EfficientNet-B4 | 19M | 18 | 74.5% | -10.8pp |

**Insight:** CLIP's vision-language alignment from pre-training provides crucial semantic understanding. Larger ViT-L offers minimal gains at 3.25× latency cost.

#### Ablation 3: Action Parameterization

*Table 11: Effect of action representation on task success. Joint velocities outperform end-effector control for our 3-DoF setup.*

{/* TODO: Add actual action space ablation */}

| Action Space | Dimensions | Success Rate | $\Delta$ |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Joint Velocities (Ours)** | 3 | **85.3%** | Baseline |
| Joint Positions | 3 | 81.7% | -3.6pp |
| End-Effector Velocity | 3 (x, y, z) | 77.4% | -7.9pp |
| End-Effector Pose | 6 (redundant) | 68.2% | -17.1pp |
| Hybrid (Pos + Vel) | 6 | 83.5% | -1.8pp |

**Insight:** Direct joint velocity control avoids IK ambiguities and provides smoother motion for low-DoF systems.

#### Ablation 4: Amount of On-Robot Fine-Tuning

*Table 12: Comparison of fine-tuning strategies. PPO with 50 episodes significantly outperforms zero-shot and behavior cloning.*

{/* TODO: Fill in actual fine-tuning comparison */}

| Fine-Tuning Method | Data | Success Rate | $\Delta$ |
|-------------------|------|--------------|----------|
| Zero-Shot (No FT) | 0 eps | 34.2% | -51.1pp |
| BC (10 demos) | 10 eps | 58.3% | -27.0pp |
| BC (30 demos) | 30 eps | 68.7% | -16.6pp |
| **PPO (Ours)** | **50 eps** | **85.3%** | **Baseline** |
| BC (50 demos) | 50 eps | 72.3% | -13.0pp |
| PPO (100 eps) | 100 eps | 88.2% | +2.9pp |

**Insight:** RL-based fine-tuning handles distribution shift better than pure imitation. Returns diminish beyond 50 episodes.

#### Ablation 5: LoRA Rank for Adaptation

*Table 13: Effect of LoRA rank on adaptation quality. Rank-16 balances expressiveness and regularization.*

{/* TODO: Add LoRA rank ablation */}

| LoRA Rank | Trainable Params | Success Rate | Training Time | $\Delta$ |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| No LoRA (Full FT) | 850M | 82.1% | 6.5 hrs | -3.2pp |
| Rank 4 | 5.5M | 79.8% | 2.2 hrs | -5.5pp |
| Rank 8 | 11M | 83.2% | 2.3 hrs | -2.1pp |
| **Rank 16 (Ours)** | **22M** | **85.3%** | **2.5 hrs** | **Baseline** |
| Rank 32 | 44M | 85.7% | 3.1 hrs | +0.4pp |
| Rank 64 | 88M | 85.9% | 4.8 hrs | +0.6pp |

**Insight:** Rank-16 provides sufficient capacity for embodiment adaptation while maintaining training efficiency. Higher ranks yield diminishing returns.

### Generalization Results

We evaluate generalization across several axes:

*Table 14: Out-of-distribution generalization performance. Model maintains 78.6% success on held-out variations.*

{/* TODO: Add OOD evaluation results */}

| Generalization Axis | Test Condition | Success Rate | vs In-Dist |
|--------------------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| In-Distribution | Standard test set | 85.3% | Baseline |
| **Novel Objects** | 5 unseen categories | 42.3% ± 8.7% | -43.0pp |
| **Instruction Paraphrasing** | 5 rephrasings/task | 78.6% ± 4.1% | -6.7pp |
| **Lighting Variation** | Low/high/side light | 53.2% - 81.4% | -4.0pp avg |
| **Position Randomization** | ±5cm (vs ±3cm) | 76.2% ± 5.3% | -9.1pp |
| **Zero-Shot Composition** | Task combinations | 62.3% ± 5.8% | -23.0pp |

**Key Findings:**
- Strong generalization to instruction variations (only -6.7pp drop)
- Moderate robustness to lighting and position changes
- Significant challenge with novel object categories and task compositions
- Results highlight importance of diverse pre-training data
