## Teleoperation (Dataset Recording)

Record [LeRobot v3](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/en/lerobot-dataset-v3) datasets by teleoperating an SO100 or SO101 leader arm to control a simulated follower in any SO101-Nexus environment. A Gradio web UI handles session configuration, live recording, and episode review.

### Prerequisites

Before using teleop, you need to set up and calibrate your physical SO101 (or SO100) leader arm:

- **SO-101 setup guide**: https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/en/so101
- **SO-100 setup guide**: https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/en/so100

Follow your robot's guide to assemble, flash firmware, and run calibration. This ensures your leader arm's joint readings are accurate.

**Find your leader arm's serial port** using the LeRobot port finder:

If you're on Linux, you may need to make the serial devices writable before running the port finder or launching teleop:

```bash
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM1
```

```bash
lerobot-find-port
```

This will list connected serial devices. Note the port (e.g. `/dev/ttyACM0` or `/dev/tty.usbmodemXXX`) for the `--leader-port` argument.

### Launch the recorder

Teleoperation lives behind the backend CLI, not a standalone script:

```bash
uv run so101-nexus teleop --leader-port /dev/ttyACM0
```

For session configuration, dataset layout, and troubleshooting, see the [teleoperation guide](https://so101-nexus.com/docs/workflow/teleoperation).

The CLI opens a Gradio UI in your browser where you configure all recording parameters:

- **Environment ID**: dropdown of all registered environments
- **Robot Type**: SO100 or SO101 (warns if it mismatches the selected environment)
- **Hugging Face Repo ID**: where the dataset will be stored
- **FPS, Camera Width/Height**: recording resolution and framerate
- **Number of Episodes, Action Space**: dataset structure
- **Max Episode Duration, Countdown**: recording timing

Click **Initialize Session** to connect the leader arm and create the environment and dataset.

### Recording flow

1. Click **Start Recording** (or press Enter). A countdown gives you time to grab the leader arm.
2. Teleoperate the simulated robot. The live wrist camera feed is shown in the UI.
3. Click **Stop Recording** (or wait for max duration). The episode ends.
4. **Review** the episode: video playback, joint state trajectory plot, task description, and metadata
5. **Approve** to save the episode to the dataset, or **Discard** to drop it
6. Repeat until all episodes are recorded
7. Optionally **Push to Hub** from the completion screen

#### CLI Arguments

| Argument | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--leader-port` | `/dev/ttyACM0` | Serial port for the leader arm |
| `--leader-id` | `so101_leader` | Leader arm identifier |

## PPO Training

Use `examples/ppo_warp.py` for PPO baselines. It is the GPU-parallel CleanRL-style
recipe for `Warp*-v1` environments and keeps rollout collection on the CUDA device.
`examples/ppo.py` is the slower MuJoCo reference script and is not the recommended
path for RL baselines.

### Run one environment

```bash
uv run --extra warp --extra train python examples/ppo_warp.py \
  --env-id WarpTouch-v1 \
  --total-timesteps 5000000
```

Metrics stream to TensorBoard under `runs/`; view them with:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir runs
```

### List environment IDs

```bash
uv run python examples/list_envs.py
```

### Baseline hyperparameters

Common settings for the solved Warp baselines:

| Argument | Value |
|---|---:|
| `--num-envs` | `1024` |
| `--num-steps` | `16` |
| `--learning-rate` | `3e-4` |
| `--gamma` | `0.99` |
| `--gae-lambda` | `0.95` |
| `--num-minibatches` | `32` |
| `--update-epochs` | `10` |
| `--clip-coef` | `0.2` |
| `--ent-coef` | `0.03` |
| `--ent-coef-final` | `0.005` |
| `--vf-coef` | `0.5` |
| `--max-grad-norm` | `0.5` |
| `--target-kl` | `None` |
| `--hidden-dim` | `256` |
| `--control-mode` | `pd_joint_delta_pos` |
| `--episode-length` | `512` |

The entropy and learning-rate schedules run over `--total-timesteps`, so the step
budget is part of the recipe. PickLift uses a mild entropy warm-start and a
CleanRL-style update budget because the GPU Warp contact path is not bitwise
deterministic; the extra optimization turns early grasps into reliable lift
policies.

### Starting commands by environment

PickLift repeats the tuned defaults explicitly so copied runs keep the seed-validated
recipe even if script defaults change later.

```bash
uv run --extra warp --extra train python examples/ppo_warp.py \
  --env-id WarpTouch-v1 \
  --total-timesteps 5000000

uv run --extra warp --extra train python examples/ppo_warp.py \
  --env-id WarpLookAt-v1 \
  --total-timesteps 5000000

uv run --extra warp --extra train python examples/ppo_warp.py \
  --env-id WarpMove-v1 \
  --total-timesteps 5000000

uv run --extra warp --extra train python examples/ppo_warp.py \
  --env-id WarpPickLift-v1 \
  --total-timesteps 30000000 \
  --num-minibatches 32 \
  --update-epochs 10 \
  --ent-coef 0.03 \
  --ent-coef-final 0.005 \
  --max-grad-norm 0.5 \
  --target-kl None
```

### Results by environment

Success rate is the recent completed-episode success rate reported by the Warp
training rollout at the listed step budget. PickLift reports seed-validated results
from seeds 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (4 of 5 solved).

| env_id | steps | success rate | wall-clock |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `WarpTouch-v1` | 5.0M | 1.000 | 88 s |
| `WarpLookAt-v1` | 5.0M | 1.000 | 62 s |
| `WarpMove-v1` | 5.0M | 1.000 | 60 s |
| `WarpPickLift-v1` | 30.0M | 0.965 min, 0.973 mean, 0.985 max final | 24.5 min/run |
| `WarpPickAndPlace-v1` | none | see below | none |
| `WarpStackCube-v1` | none | none | none |

`ppo_warp.py` has no PickAndPlace baseline: pure exploration does not find the
place-and-release event often enough. Demo seeding does solve it, so use
`bc_ppo_warp.py` for that task (results under
["BC-Seeded PPO Training"](#bc-seeded-ppo-training)). `WarpStackCube-v1` has no
baseline on either script yet.

### Evaluate a checkpoint

Evaluate the saved policy deterministically with no exploration noise:

```bash
uv run --extra warp python examples/eval_warp.py \
  --env-id WarpPickLift-v1 \
  --checkpoint "runs/WarpPickLift-v1__*/best_agent.pt"
```

This works for `bc_ppo_warp.py` checkpoints too: a checkpoint records the observation
layout it was trained on, so the evaluator rebuilds a matching environment instead of
assuming the environment's current default.

### Train in Colab

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/johnsutor/so101-nexus/blob/main/examples/ppo_warp_colab.ipynb)

[`examples/ppo_warp_colab.ipynb`](ppo_warp_colab.ipynb) is a self-contained Colab
notebook: it installs the library, launches an embedded TensorBoard, trains,
evaluates, and displays a rollout video. Open it in Colab, select a GPU runtime,
and run all cells.

## BC-Seeded PPO Training

Use `examples/bc_ppo_warp.py` for demo-seeded PPO on `WarpPickLift-v1`: the exact
same GPU-parallel CleanRL PPO recipe as `ppo_warp.py` (fixed-horizon episodes,
CleanRL optimizer budget, entropy warm-start/anneal, see that file's module doc
for why each is decisive), plus behavior-cloning (BC) seeding from the 10 successful
teleop episodes in
[`johnsutor/MuJoCoPickLift-v1`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/johnsutor/MuJoCoPickLift-v1):
the actor is BC-pretrained on the demos before online PPO starts, and an optional
persistent BC loss (`--bc-coef`, default on) keeps anchoring the actor mean toward
demo actions throughout training.

### Why this over `ppo_warp.py` alone

`ppo_warp.py` already solves this task through pure exploration (~97-100% success in
~30 min), but is exploration-luck seed-fragile: a 5-seed sweep at the current default
entropy schedule (`ent_coef=0.03 -> 0.005`) passed seeds 1-4 (final success 0.97,
0.985, 0.965, 0.97) but seed 5 got stuck at a grasp-hold-at-table local optimum and
never discovered the lift (`best_success=0.037`, `final_success=0.0`). Demo-seeding
directly targets that failure mode by starting the actor near the demos' actual
grasp-lift behavior instead of a random init, without touching PPO's own decisive
fixes or trading GPU-batch throughput away for a planning bottleneck (an MPC-planning
approach, TD-MPC2, was tried first and dropped for exactly that throughput reason --
see the CHANGELOG). An [RLPD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02948)-style off-policy
alternative was considered but remains unimplemented.

### Design notes

- **`pd_joint_delta_pos` control, unchanged from `ppo_warp.py`.** The demo dataset
  records absolute joint-position targets; rather than switch control modes (risking
  the proven recipe), demo actions are recomputed as the delta between consecutive
  recorded joint states (the realized per-step motion), normalized by the same
  `_DELTA_ACTION_SCALE` the env applies internally.
- **BC touches only the actor mean**, never the critic, because the demos have no
  associated value estimates under the online policy, so biasing the critic toward
  them would corrupt the advantage estimates PPO's own gradient relies on.
  `--bc-pretrain-updates` fits the actor alone (separate optimizer, `--bc-pretrain-lr`)
  before the PPO loop starts; the persistent `--bc-coef` term adds the same MSE loss
  into every PPO minibatch update afterward, optionally annealed via
  `--bc-anneal-steps`.
- **`--no-use-demos` recovers `ppo_warp.py` exactly** (same Agent, same env
  helpers, same PPO loss): this file is a strict superset, not a fork with
  behavior drift.

### Run it

```bash
uv run --extra warp --extra train python examples/bc_ppo_warp.py
```

### Baseline hyperparameters

Same PPO baseline table as `ppo_warp.py`'s ["Baseline hyperparameters"](#baseline-hyperparameters)
above, plus:

| Argument | Value |
|---|---:|
| `--use-demos` / `--no-use-demos` | `--use-demos` |
| `--bc-pretrain-updates` | `2000` |
| `--bc-pretrain-lr` | `1e-3` |
| `--bc-coef` | `0.1` |
| `--bc-anneal-steps` | `0` (constant) |

### Results

**`WarpPickLift-v1`**, validated against the exact seed (5) that fails under
`ppo_warp.py`'s current default recipe, same `--total-timesteps 30000000`:

| Run | seed | best success | final success |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `ppo_warp.py` (no demos) | 5 | 0.037 | 0.000 |
| `bc_ppo_warp.py` (demo-seeded) | 5 | 0.993 | 0.983 |

Same step budget, same entropy and optimizer schedule, so demo-seeding is the only
difference, and it rescues the seed outright rather than nudging it. Success climbed
steadily from the BC-pretrained start (0.003 at 1.6M steps) through 0.807 at 6.6M,
crossing 0.95 by 8.2M and holding through 30M. TensorBoard under `runs/` shows the
full curve for any local reproduction.

**`WarpPickAndPlace-v1`** has no `ppo_warp.py` baseline at all, and is solved here
with the opt-in flags from the module docstring:

```bash
uv run --extra warp --extra train python examples/bc_ppo_warp.py \
  --env-id WarpPickAndPlace-v1 \
  --demo-repo johnsutor/MuJoCoPickAndPlace-v1 \
  --success-bonus 50 \
  --total-timesteps 160000000 \
  --anneal-timesteps 80000000 \
  --lr-min-frac 0.1
```

3 seeds reach `best_success` 0.927, 0.912, and 0.743 (mean 0.861, std 0.083). A
100-episode MuJoCo-transfer eval of the seed-1 checkpoint measured
`success_rate=0.870` (95% CI approx +/- 0.066).
