# Reward engineering for so101-nexus environments

Procedural guide for writing a new task's reward, or auditing an existing one, so
dense shaping helps training instead of becoming the thing the policy learns to
game. Grounded in a real, previously-shipped bug: `PickAndPlaceEnv`'s
`task_progress` term let a policy collect ~90% of the reward budget forever by
hovering a grasped object above the goal without ever placing it.

## The core failure mode: dwelling rewards

A **dwelling** reward term is a function of the *current state alone*,
recomputed fresh every step: `r_t = f(s_t)`. If `f` saturates near its maximum
before the task's actual `success` condition fires, and the episode does not
terminate until `success`, a policy that reaches a high-`f` state and then does
*nothing further* collects that near-maximum reward every remaining step of the
episode -- often far more total return than a policy that pushes on to finish
and terminate early. This is not a hypothetical: `Amodei, Olah, Steinhardt,
Christiano, Schulman & Mane, "Concrete Problems in AI Safety," arXiv:1606.06565
(2016)` name this *reward hacking* as one of five concrete AI-accident problem
classes, and `Krakovna, Uesato, Mikulik, Rahtz, Everitt, Kumar, Kenton, Leike &
Legg, "Specification gaming: the flip side of AI ingenuity" (DeepMind, 2020,
tinyurl.com/specification-gaming)` catalogue ~60 real instances, including a
Lego-stacking agent (`Popov, Heess, Lillicrap, Hafner, Barth-Maron, Vecerik,
Lampe, Tassa, Erez & Riedmiller, "Data-efficient Deep RL for Dexterous
Manipulation," arXiv:1704.03073, 2017`) rewarded for a block's height that
simply flipped the block instead of stacking it.

**Multi-phase tasks are the highest-risk shape.** A task whose `success`
requires state B *after* first passing through state A (e.g. grasp-then-lower,
reach-then-release, pick-then-place) is dangerous whenever the natural,
easiest-to-explore trajectory reaches a *dwelling-rewarding* state A and stops
there, because completing the task requires *reversing or complicating* the
just-learned behaviour (releasing a grasp, lowering back down, decelerating).
Single-phase tasks (reach a point, look at an object) are comparatively safe:
crossing the completion threshold is not a reversal of the most-explored
trajectory, so the same failure mode is far less likely to be where training
actually gets stuck -- but it is not categorically impossible, so still check.

## Checklist when writing a reward for a new task

1. **Read `so101_nexus/rewards.py` first.** Reuse `reach_progress`,
   `orientation_progress`, `lift_progress`, `simple_reward`,
   `potential_shaping`, `place_task_potential`, `place_reach_potential`,
   `place_grasp_potential` -- never inline a shaping formula. If none of these
   fit, propose a new one there (never in a backend env class); see
   `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`'s "Reward functions live in `so101_nexus.rewards`" rule.
2. **Write down `success` first**, as a precise boolean predicate over state.
   Then ask: is there a *strict subset* of `success`'s conditions that a
   dwelling reward term would saturate on? If yes, that subset is the exploit
   surface -- this is exactly what happened when `task_progress` rewarded
   goal-xy proximity alone while `success` additionally required height and
   staticness.
3. **For any term that is part of, or a proxy for, the multi-phase completion
   surface identified in step 2**: make it a **potential-based delta**, not a
   raw state value.
   - Define a potential function `Phi(s)` in `[0, 1]` that is zero until every
     phase relevant to that term has genuinely started (e.g. gate on "grasped
     or already placed"). Build it as **boolean phase gates around an
     additive, staged progress sum** (ManiSkill PickCube's dense-reward shape:
     `reaching + is_grasped + place*is_grasped + static*is_obj_placed`), NOT
     as a product of continuous progress factors. Products are how you gate
     *raw dwelling* terms, where coasting on one maxed factor is the threat; a
     potential *delta* already pays ~0 for coasting, so the product buys
     nothing and instead lets any one small factor mute every other factor's
     gradient -- an arm-stillness factor at realistic carry speed multiplied
     pick-and-place's entire transport gradient down to ~1e-7/step (see the
     worked example below).
   - **Walk `Phi` through the ideal trajectory phase by phase before shipping
     it** (approach, grasp, lift, carry, lower, release, settle) and check it
     never decreases: any dip means `potential_shaping` pays *negative* reward
     for mandatory forward progress. Shaping is policy-invariant for ANY
     `Phi`, so you are free to pick one that ranks states in the right order
     -- delta-shaping fixes dwelling, it cannot fix a potential that ranks a
     later phase below an earlier one. The three traps found in the shipped
     pick-and-place potential:
     1. *Undo-factors*: a height-back-near-rest factor pays negative on the
        lift the task requires. Measure transport with a distance under which
        the lift is free, e.g. Chebyshev `max(xy_dist, height_gap)` (a plain
        3D norm still dips slightly on lift-off).
     2. *Gradient-muting products*: stillness x transport zeroes the carry
        gradient at any realistic arm speed. Make stillness additive and gate
        it on `is_obj_placed` (ManiSkill's `static_reward * is_obj_placed`).
     3. *Missing successor holds*: a sub-potential a later phase must undo
        (grasp before release, reach before retreat) pays a negative delta at
        the finish unless held up by its successor condition: `grasped OR
        placed` (`rewards.place_grasp_potential`), `max(reach, placed)`
        (`rewards.place_reach_potential`). Keep the negative delta for
        genuine regressions -- if dropping the object paid 0 while grasping
        paid +, a grasp-drop-regrasp cycle would pump unbounded reward;
        symmetric deltas make every closed loop net exactly 0.
   - Feed `rewards.potential_shaping(Phi(s'), Phi(s))` as the term's value
     instead of `Phi(s')` directly. This requires tracking `Phi(s_prev)` as
     per-episode state on the env (a plain attribute for the scalar MuJoCo
     backend, a `(num_envs,)` tensor updated by index for the batched Warp
     backend), seeded post-settle in `_refresh_reset_reference_state` (mirror
     the existing `_initial_obj_z` baseline pattern) and updated once per real
     step inside `_compute_reward`/`_compute_reward_terminated` *after* reading
     the previous value.
   - This is the `gamma=1` telescoping special case of `Ng, Harada & Russell,
     "Policy Invariance Under Reward Transformations: Theory and Application to
     Reward Shaping," ICML 1999` (Theorem 1: `F(s,a,s') = gamma*Phi(s') -
     Phi(s)` is necessary and sufficient for the shaped MDP's optimal policy to
     equal the unshaped MDP's). Summed over an episode it telescopes to
     `Phi(final) - Phi(initial)`, bounded regardless of dwell time, so standing
     still nets ~0 further reward. Use `gamma=1` rather than a full discount
     because the env does not know the training algorithm's `gamma`; this is
     exact at `gamma=1` and a close approximation for `gamma` near 1 (typical
     PPO/FPO settings, 0.95-0.99). If a term's potential is genuinely
     phase/time-dependent (not just state-dependent), see `Devlin & Kudenko,
     "Dynamic Potential-Based Reward Shaping," AAMAS 2012` (Eq. 4), which
     extends the same guarantee to `Phi(s, t)`.
   - **Do not soften `success`/`terminated` itself into a continuous proxy to
     get partial credit.** Get partial credit from the *shaping* potential
     instead. A soft success proxy that never has to cross the real threshold
     just relocates the exploit to a new, not-yet-discovered shape (a policy
     that maximizes the soft proxy without ever really finishing) -- this is
     the mistake to avoid, not a hypothetical: see the "Concrete changes"
     section of the design note above for the reasoning trail.
4. **Terms that are NOT part of the completion surface** (e.g. a generic
   TCP-to-object reach term while the object is still far away) can stay flat
   dwelling terms at a modest budget weight; not everything needs potential
   shaping, only the specific surface a policy could exploit to avoid
   finishing. Reserve the biggest weight cut for `completion_bonus`, not the
   dwelling terms, if you are tuning a budget split.
5. **Verify `terminated == success`** in both backends' `step()` (already the
   base-class contract) so a real completion always ends the episode -- a
   potential-based term only closes the *dwelling* exploit; if the episode
   never ends on success, dwelling on the terminal state itself becomes the new
   exploit.
6. **Write the regression test before you trust the fix.** Simulate "hover"
   (call the reward computation twice with an unchanged potential) and assert
   the potential-shaped facet of `info["reward_components"]` is ~0 on the
   second call; then simulate genuine progress (potential increases) and assert
   real credit is paid. See `test_pick_and_place_hovering_earns_no_dwelling_task_objective_reward`
   in `tests/mujoco/test_envs.py` for the pattern.
7. Consider the sparse-reward alternative. `Andrychowicz, Wolski, Ray,
   Schneider, Fong, Welinder, McGrew, Tobin, Abbeel & Zaremba, "Hindsight
   Experience Replay," NeurIPS 2017 (arXiv:1707.01495)` is the other major
   line of attack on this class of problem: train off-policy on a sparse
   binary success signal and relabel failed trajectories with the goal they
   *actually* reached, removing the dense-shaping exploit surface entirely by
   not having one. Not applicable to this repo's on-policy training recipes
   today (HER needs an off-policy, replay-buffer algorithm and a
   goal-conditioned value function), but worth naming when proposing a new
   training recipe, not just a new env.

## Worked example

Read `potential_shaping` and `place_task_potential` in
`src/so101_nexus/rewards.py` for the implementation shared by the MuJoCo and
Warp backends.

The pick-and-place reward needed three corrections. First, task progress became
potential-shaped deltas to stop paying for hovering above the goal. Reaching and
grasping then needed the same treatment because their combined dwelling reward
became the next exploitable ceiling.

Finally, the potential itself had to increase along a successful trajectory.
A product of lift, transport, and stillness terms penalized required motion and
release. The staged additive `place_task_potential` and `is_obj_placed` successor
holds address that problem. Audit both the shaping mechanism and its potential.
