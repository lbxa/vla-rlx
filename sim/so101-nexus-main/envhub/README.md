# SO101-Nexus environments

Twelve SO-101 manipulation environments, loadable through
[LeRobot EnvHub](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/en/envhub). Tasks run on a
CPU MuJoCo backend or a GPU-batched MuJoCo Warp backend, from
[so101-nexus](https://github.com/johnsutor/so101-nexus).

```python
from lerobot.envs.factory import make_env

envs = make_env(
    "johnsutor/so101-nexus-envs:envs/MuJoCoPickLift-v1.py",
    n_envs=4,
    trust_remote_code=True,
)
env = envs["MuJoCoPickLift-v1"][0]
obs, info = env.reset(seed=0)
```

Loading `env.py` at the repository root gives `MuJoCoPickLift-v1`. Every other
environment has its own file under `envs/`.

## Install

```bash
pip install "so101-nexus>=0.5.0"          # MuJoCo* environments
pip install "so101-nexus[warp]>=0.5.0"    # adds the Warp* environments (CUDA)
```

The environment code is the installed library, not this repository: these files
are thin shims over `so101_nexus.envhub`, so the physics, rewards, and
observation layouts are versioned and tested with the package.

The v2 entry points require a library build that includes `PickAndPlaceV2Config`.
The PickReturn entry points require a library build that includes `PickReturnConfig`.
See the [environment reference](https://so101-nexus.com/docs/environments) for the versioned placement contract.

State dimensions are the default observation layout; they change with the
`observations` component list. Task semantics are identical across the two
backends. The MuJoCo backend builds `n_envs` independent copies, stepped one
after another in the calling process by default or in worker processes with
`use_async_envs=True`; the Warp backend runs `n_envs` worlds inside one batched
simulator.

## Observations and actions

`obs_type="state"` (the default) returns:

- `agent_pos`: `(n_envs, 6)` joint positions, in radians
- `environment_state`: `(n_envs, state_dim)` full state vector

`obs_type="pixels_agent_pos"` returns:

- `agent_pos`: `(n_envs, 6)` joint positions, in radians
- `pixels`: `{"wrist": ..., "overhead": ...}`, HWC uint8 images

`pixels_agent_pos` carries no `environment_state`: the full task state stays in
`info["privileged_state"]`, the privileged half of the asymmetric actor-critic
split, so a pixels policy cannot read it out of its observation.

LeRobot's `preprocess_observation` maps these to `observation.state`,
`observation.environment_state`, and `observation.images.<camera>`. The language
instruction for the current episode is read off `task_description`, and success
is reported in `info["final_info"]["is_success"]` on the terminating step.

Actions are `(n_envs, 6)` absolute joint targets in radians by default
(`control_mode="pd_joint_pos"`). Delta joint modes and end-effector modes
(`pd_joint_delta_pos`, `pd_ee_pose`, `pd_ee_delta_pose`) are selectable per
environment.

Units are the simulator's own. Datasets recorded through the library's LeRobot
follower adapter store LeRobot motor units instead (degrees, with the gripper in
`RANGE_0_100`); convert with `so101_nexus.dataset_row_to_sim_qpos`.

## Configuration

A `HubEnvConfig` selects the environment through its `task` field:

```python
from lerobot.envs.factory import make_env
from lerobot.envs.configs import HubEnvConfig

cfg = HubEnvConfig(hub_path="johnsutor/so101-nexus-envs", task="MuJoCoStackCube-v1")
envs = make_env(cfg, n_envs=2, trust_remote_code=True)
```

A file under `envs/` pins its own id, so `task` is ignored when the hub path
names one; select by `task` through the root `env.py`.

`obs_type`, `observation_width`, `observation_height`, `episode_length` and
`disable_env_checker` are read off the config too when it carries them
(LeRobot's `LiberoEnv` carries the first four), as is a free-form `kwargs` dict
(`IsaaclabArenaEnv` carries one). For the full option set without a config
class, call the library entry point directly:

```python
from so101_nexus.envhub import make_env

envs = make_env(
    n_envs=2,
    env_id="MuJoCoStackCube-v1",
    obs_type="pixels_agent_pos",
    observation_width=224,
    observation_height=224,
    episode_length=300,
    control_mode="pd_joint_delta_pos",
    render_mode="rgb_array",
)
```

Recognized options: `env_id`, `obs_type`, `observation_width`,
`observation_height`, `episode_length`, `control_mode`, `render_mode`,
`disable_env_checker`, `device` (Warp only), and `config` (a fully built
`so101_nexus` environment config, which overrides `obs_type` and the camera
resolution).

## Notes on the Warp backend

The Warp environments are natively batched on one device and speak torch
tensors. The EnvHub adapter converts to NumPy at the boundary because that is
what LeRobot's rollout consumes, which copies each observation to host memory
every step. For GPU-resident training loops, use
`gymnasium.make_vec("WarpPickLift-v1", num_envs=...)` directly. They also seed
one generator for the whole batch, so a per-world seed list collapses to its
first entry.

`use_async_envs` is ignored here. On the MuJoCo ids it is honored, but LeRobot's
own rollout indexes `VectorEnv.envs`, which Gymnasium's `AsyncVectorEnv` does not
expose, so leave it off whenever LeRobot drives the environment.
