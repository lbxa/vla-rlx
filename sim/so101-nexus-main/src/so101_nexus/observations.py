"""Composable observation components for SO101-Nexus environments.

Observation components are lightweight descriptor classes that tell
environments which data to include in the observation vector. They
follow the same pattern as ``SceneObject`` subclasses: pure-data
config objects consumed by backend-specific environment code.

State components produce fixed-size slices of the flat observation
vector. Camera components add image tensors to a dict-style
observation space.

Typical usage::

    from so101_nexus.observations import JointPositions, ObjectOffset

    config = TouchConfig(observations=[JointPositions(), ObjectOffset()])
