    The ``gamma=1`` telescoping special case of Ng, Harada & Russell's

    Transformations," ICML 1999, Theorem 1): a shaping reward of the form
    ``F(s, s') = gamma * Phi(s') - Phi(s)`` is a necessary and sufficient
    condition for the shaped MDP's optimal policy to equal the unshaped one's.
    Summed over an episode this term telescopes to ``Phi(final) - Phi(initial)``,
    bounded regardless of episode length, so a policy that reaches a high
    potential and then stops moving earns ~0 further reward instead of the
    unbounded dwelling reward a raw ``Phi(s')`` term would pay out every step

    ``gamma=1`` rather than Devlin & Kudenko's fully general dynamic potential
    ("Dynamic Potential-Based Reward Shaping," AAMAS 2012, Eq. 4) because
    callers here do not know the training algorithm's discount factor; for
    ``gamma`` close to 1 (typical PPO/FPO settings, 0.95-0.99) this is a close
